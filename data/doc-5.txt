Uncle Tom’s Cabin tells the story of Uncle Tom, an enslaved person, depicted as 
saintly and dignified, noble and steadfast in his beliefs. While being transported 
by boat to auction in New Orleans, Tom saves the life of Little Eva, an angelic 
and forgiving young girl, whose grateful father then purchases Tom. Eva and Tom 
soon become great friends. Always frail, Eva’s health begins to decline rapidly, 
and on her deathbed she asks her father to free all his enslaved people. He makes 
plans to do so but is then killed, and the brutal Simon Legree, Tom’s new owner, 
has Tom whipped to death after he refuses to divulge the whereabouts of certain 
escaped slaves. Tom maintains a steadfastly Christian attitude toward his own 
suffering, and Stowe imbues Tom’s death with echoes of Christ’s.

Simon Legree, the principal villain in the story, represents greed and brutality, 
a man who chose sin over reform. Legree forces enslaved persons into different 
roles in his life. A woman named Cassy is forced to live with him. When Legree 
buys Tom, he also buys a 15-year-old girl named Emmeline, whom he intends to keep 
as a replacement for Cassy. Through punishment and reward, Legree turns Quimbo 
and Sambo into his companions and enforcers. The two men are coerced into beating 
other enslaved people at Legree’s command. It is Quimbo and Sambo who whip Tom 
to his death; as Tom lay dying, they express remorse and shame. Tom forgives 
them before he dies.
